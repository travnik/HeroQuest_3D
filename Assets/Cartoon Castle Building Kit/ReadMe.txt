Hello and thank you for purchasing Cartoon Castle Building Kit package.

Important things to know:
- I set snap settings to 0.25 on all axes for this project.
- Lightmaps are mostly self made and some fbx have lihtmaps generated on import. 
- Prefabs have colliders.
- Prefabs are set to all static.
- On screenshots and video I used bloom effect from Post Processing Stack.

Most materials share one material and atlas texture 1024*1024 png.
There is 203 fbx files all made to two prefabs.
